Musosphere seeks to display relationships between artists by mashing up data from the Twitter and Last.fm databases.

INTRODUCTION
The program is split into two main components. Fetch.rb downloads additional artist data into the database, while musosphere.rb displays the already-captured information. 

The visualization is organized using the Stress MAjorization of a COmplex Function (SMACOF) algorithm for multidimensional scaling. Artists that share more "similar artists" on Last.fm are grouped closer together. Twitter relationships is represented as a line connecting two spheres; artists with a larger Twitter following (amongst the artists here) have a larger radius.

DEPENDENCIES
Musosphere.rb needs Ruby 1.9.3 to run, for the updated built-in Matrix module. It also requires ruby-processing, which can be installed with this command:

sudo gem install ruby-processing

Musosphere.rb also requires the activerecord and activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter gems, which must be installed within JRuby itself. Use the following commands to do so:

jruby -S gem install activerecord
jruby -S gem install activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter

Then the program can be run with the following command:

rp5 run musosphere.rb --jruby

Fetch.rb requires the twitter, lastfm, activerecord, sqlite3, and launchy gems. Execute the following commands before running it:

sudo gem install twitter
sudo gem install lastfm
sudo gem install activerecord
sudo gem install sqlite3
sudo gem install launchy

You will also need to create a file, "keys.rb", and populate it with your own API keys from Last.fm and Twitter; the format is as follows:

LASTFM_API_KEY = "x"
LASTFM_API_SECRET = "x"

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = "x"
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = "x"
TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN = "x"
TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = "x"
